# User Experience

The targeted audience for this site is horse racing enthusiasts, breeders and purchasers. The aim of the site is to have a reliable place of information and a point of contact for all DBS Bloodstock related queries. The site is intentionally simply layed out to convey information efficiently

## 1. Strategy
Customer Goals:
- A space to provide up to date information on horses currently owned
- Somewhere to advertise horses for sale as the bloodstock comoany grows in the future
- An easy way for others to get in contact DBS bloodstock

Personal Goals:
- Simply lay out content provided in a user friendly way
- Highlight the achievements of the horse A Step Too Far who broke records in 2020 winning 6 races in a row

## 2. Scope
The idea was to keep the content as simple as possible. Initally the idea was to have a page for horses in training and another for breeding horses or 'broodmares'. The broodmares page was held from the final product for now as i am still awaiting some piece of content from particular associations.

I wanted to include a visual to display the 6 in a row wins of A Step Too Far. I found a timeline online (referenced below) and edited it to fit my content and include links to all 6 races.

DBS Bloodstock is part of a parent company, DBS Group so it was important for me to link DBS Group in the footer. DBS Group or Bloodstock do not use social media

## 3. Structure
I wanted to make the structure of the website to revolve around the most visual aspects. DBS Bloodstock has some striking photographs of A Step Too Far which i wanted to use as the centre piece of both the home page and 'Horses in Training' page.

The aim of the homepage is to display photos and give the user an inital idea of what DBS Bloodstock is about and what is happening lately with a news sector.

The Horses in Training page is structured to display the information a horse racing enthusiast values the most i.e. photos, pedigrees and racing records

The contact page is structured to be simple and aesthetically pleasing

## 4. Skeleton
The skeleton is based on [Wireframes](assets/wireframes/wireframes.pdf)

## 5. Surface 
Since DBS Bloodstock is part of a parent company [DBS Group](www.dbsgroup.ie) i wanted to make the websites similar on the Surface

I used colours from the logo (#99c45 and #52618f) throughout the page

I used Open Sans throughout the page to match the parent company site 

All images used were provided by different Horse Racing Ireland after each win by A Step Too Far
